## Why Do you need custom icons?

The main question is do you really need to use custom icons? The internet is overloaded with free graphic icon resources. Many of us use similar services from time to time. However, it is difficult sometimes to find a ready-to-use pack of icons in one style that will more or less correspond to the brand identity of your website. That is why we need more of them.

One of the most important reasons to create your own icons is customization. Custom icons will fit your brand design and become an integral part of your brand voice.

Tailored, well-designed icon sets can become an effective communication tool and provide you with awesome results extending your brand.

## The main features of the plugin:

* Custom Elementor Icons allows you to add unlimited icons to your website. The plugin supports compatibility with different services, such as IcoMoon, which will help you to generate icon fonts. This service allows you to create and save your own icon sets, either from pre-built icon packs or from your custom SVG icons.

* With this software, you can add custom icons anywhere on your website.

* The plugin works perfectly with page builders and is very easy to use.

## Simple work with the Custom Elementor Icons plugin

We tried to keep the plugin simple so that it will be easy for the user to navigate it and understand its operation process. All you have to do is generate the set of your custom icons and upload it to the website via the plugin.

You can use some services such as IcoMoon, upload there your SVG icon files and generate the fonts of your icons. Then you will need to download the .zip file and upload it to your website through the plugin assistance. After that just access your new library and select the icon you want to use.

## Compatibility with Page Builder

The plugin helps you to take full control over your WP content thanks to its compatibility with the page builders — Elementor and WPBakery. You can use either of the two options as your page builder and still be sure that the plugin is working perfectly with any of them.

The interface of the software is very simple and consistent. Two steps are required to complete the icon upload. Simply navigate to the plugin menu and upload new icons. Once it is done, all the new icons, customized and unique, will be available inside the new icon library.

Next, with the help of icon selectors, you can paste the chosen element to any page or post and keep one style for your WordPress site content.

Every icon you use, no matter which library it comes from, is edited and styled using Elementor’s native styling controls. It completely changes the usual way designers work with custom icons.

All in all, you will be able to speed up your design workflow and remain consistent with your WP website appearance. Don’t settle for packs from Font Awesome Icons, build your own sets of brand icons for the WordPress website and style them as you want with the help of our plugin.
