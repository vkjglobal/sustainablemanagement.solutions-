Would you want to work with a consultation company whose office was in shambles? We judge things often by their appearance, especially when seeing something for the first time. If you are an excellent company with a bad image or appearance then you may have loyal clients but new clients will be hard to get.

What does work, however, is the ability to present the company as being professional and experienced. When we walk into an office that is neatly arranged and greatly designed we immediately begin to think positively about the company.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/2"][stm_charts values="%5B%7B%22title%22%3A%22One%22%2C%22y_values%22%3A%2210%3B%2015%3B%2020%3B%2025%3B%2027%3B%2025%3B%2023%3B%2025%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%23fe6c61%22%7D%2C%7B%22title%22%3A%22Two%22%2C%22y_values%22%3A%2225%3B%2018%3B%2016%3B%2017%3B%2020%3B%2025%3B%2030%3B%2035%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%235472d2%22%7D%5D" width="395" height="300"][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][vc_tta_tabs shape="square" spacing="" active_section="1" el_class="theme_style"][vc_tta_section title="challenge" tab_id="1453266957006-3f3e3dff-6ef8"][vc_column_text]The challenge is to bring a company whose web presence is boring up to date. The challenge is to ensure that when a client visits your website they feel positive about your company. The challenge is that most customers will judge you based on appearance alone, and if your website looks unprofessional or poorly made then they will think your company as a whole is unprofessional.
